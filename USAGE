Installing
----------

This code should build and install on FreeBSD via "make all install".

Configuration
-------------

This code ships with several configuration files:

imds.conf				- Sample configuration for imds-proxy
freebsd-conf/newsyslog-imds.conf	- newsyslog conf for /var/log/imds.log
freebsd-conf/syslog-imds.conf		- syslog conf for /var/log/imds.log
freebsd-conf/rc.d-imds-{filterd, proxy}	- FreeBSD rc.d scripts.

In addition, the user and group imds:imds must be created in order for the
rc.d scripts to function.

Using the FreeBSD port is recommended since it will automate dispersing the
configuration files and creating the user and group.

Usage
-----

On FreeBSD:
1. Install the "security/imds-filterd" port or the "imds-filterd" package.
2. Add imds_filterd_enable=YES to /etc/rc.conf.
3. Edit imds.conf as desired.
4. Reboot, or start daemons:
	service imds-filterd start
	service imds-proxy start
